ctrlplane is a multi stage release rollout engine for cloud-native applications. It is designed to be used in 
conjunction with a CI/CD pipeline & near realtime application monitoring to provide a safe and reliable rollout 
process with rollbacks for microservices.

Currently, it only supports monorepo, but poly repo support is on the roadmap.
