// MutexWorkflow is the mutex workflow. It controls access to a resource.
//
// IMPORTANT: Do not use this function directly. Instead, use mutex.New to create and interact with mutex instances.
//
// The workflow consists of three main event loops:
//  1. Main loop: Handles acquiring, releasing, and timing out of locks.
//  2. Prepare loop: Listens for and handles preparation of lock requests.
//  3. Cleanup loop: Manages the cleanup process and potential workflow shutdown.
//
// It operates as a state machine, transitioning between MutexStatus states:
// Acquiring -> Locked -> Releasing -> Released (or Timeout)
//
// Uses two pools to manage lock requests:
//   - Main pool: Tracks active lock requests and currently held locks.
//   - Orphans pool: Tracks locks that have timed out.
//
// Responds to several signals:
//   - WorkflowSignalPrepare: Prepares a new lock request.
//   - WorkflowSignalAcquire: Attempts to acquire a lock.
//   - WorkflowSignalRelease: Releases a held lock.
//   - WorkflowSignalCleanup: Initiates the cleanup process.
