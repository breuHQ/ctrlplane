// Workflow is the mutex workflow. It is responsible for controlling the access to a resource. It should always be started as
// a child workflow.
// It works by listening to two signals:
//   - WorkflowSignalAcquire: this signal is sent by the caller to acquire the lock.
//   - WorkflowSignalRelease: this signal is sent by the caller to release the lock.
//
// FIXME: Re-evaluate Lock.Start() behavior.
//
// Currently, `Lock.Start()` starts the worker as a child workflow. While this ensures termination when the parent workflow finishes,
// it conflicts with the purpose of blocking on a resource. Although Temporal's idempotency key prevents duplicate workflows for the
// same resource, subsequent workflows attempting to start the child workflow will encounter errors.
//
// Should we instead use a signal-based approach for starting the lock workflow? This would allow other parts of the core system
// to acquire and wait on the lock. However, a graceful cleanup mechanism would be necessary.
