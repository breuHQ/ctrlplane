# Merge Responsibility

At least two reviews are required before one can merge back. Manager approval doesn't count. Yes, that is right! Maybe you a manager and this made you think, “**_WHAT? I am a manager, and an amazing coder, and my review totally counts, how dare you!!_**”. But you have to consider how much time your manager spends coding. Is it more than 50%? Then they are also a developer, so okay, let’s count them. At the end of the day, it is the developers who have to live with the code that’s being written. Therefore developers get the final say. What we aim to prevent is a manager-developer infinite approval cycle where a manager keeps approving one developer’s PRs even though there are 3 other developers on the team who haven’t had a chance to look at it yet.
